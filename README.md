# Institute for Advanced Criminal Law Studies

The Institute for Advanced Criminal Law Studies is a non-profit corporation dedicated to novel scholarship, thorough education, and zealous advocacy for the improvement of all aspects of the criminal-justice system for the People.

Think of it as a skunkworks for criminal-defense lawyering.
